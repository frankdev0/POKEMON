This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# PokeAPI Challenge Solution Documentation

## Overview

This documentation serves as a guide and a reflection of the solution implemented for the PokeAPI Challenge using the Next.js framework. The deployed application successfully consumes data from the PokeAPI to present Pokémon types, lists of Pokémon by category, search capabilities, and detailed Pokémon statistics.

## Features

### Pokémon Types Listing

The main page of the application showcases a comprehensive list of all Pokémon types, as retrieved from the PokeAPI endpoint `/type`. This interactive list provides users with an overview of the diverse categories of Pokémon available in the database.

### Pokémon List by Category

Upon selecting a specific Pokémon type, users are presented with a corresponding list of Pokémon belonging to the chosen category. This list is dynamically generated based on the data fetched from the endpoint `/type/{id}`, where `{id}` corresponds to the selected type's identifier.

### Pagination

For categories with an extensive number of Pokémon, a client-side pagination mechanism was implemented to maintain performance and usability. The pagination controls allow users to navigate through the dataset, with a maximum of 25 Pokémon displayed per page. This ensures the application remains responsive and user-friendly even when handling large volumes of data.

### Search Capability

A real-time search feature enables users to filter the Pokémon list by names. This functionality was designed to be highly responsive, providing immediate feedback as the user types in the search field. It improves the overall experience by allowing users to quickly locate specific Pokémon within a potentially vast list.

### Pokémon Details and Stats Display

Clicking on an individual Pokémon triggers a detailed view, where users can explore in-depth information about the Pokémon's attributes. The details view includes the name, Pokédex ID, height, weight, abilities, and a breakdown of base stats. The data for this feature is obtained from the `/pokemon/{pokemon_name}` endpoint.

## Technical Implementation

The application was developed using the Next.js framework, capitalizing on its server-side rendering capabilities for enhanced performance. The project structure follows best practices for Next.js applications, with pages, components, and hooks organized in an intuitive manner.

Each feature was carefully crafted to align with the challenge requirements. For instance, the pagination logic was implemented using state management to track the current page and adjust the displayed list of Pokémon accordingly. The search functionality was optimized using a combination of local state and efficient array manipulation to filter results.

## User Interface

The UI design focuses on simplicity and clarity, ensuring a smooth user experience across desktop and mobile devices. The layout is clean and navigable, with emphasis placed on accessibility and intuitive interactions.

For the detailed Pokémon view, a modal presentation was chosen to provide a non-intrusive and context-preserving interface element. This allows users to view details without navigating away from the list, enhancing the exploratory aspect of the application.

## Testing and Validation

Extensive testing was conducted to ensure that all features operate as intended. The search and pagination were particularly emphasized during testing, considering their complexity and importance to the user experience.

The application was also tested across various devices and browsers to confirm its responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

## Deployment

The completed application has been deployed and is accessible for public use. It stands as a testament to the effectiveness of Next.js for building performant and feature-rich web applications.

## Conclusion

The successful completion of the PokeAPI Challenge demonstrates a practical application of modern web development techniques using Next.js. This solution not only meets the defined requirements but also provides a scalable and maintainable codebase for future enhancements.
